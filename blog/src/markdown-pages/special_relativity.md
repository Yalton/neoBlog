## Introduction

Special relativity is a theory of space and time developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. The theory states that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. It states that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion, and that time is relative, meaning that time passes more slowly for observers in relative motion than for observers at rest. Special relativity also states that the length of an object and its mass both increase as the object's speed increases. Special relativity has had a profound impact on our understanding of space, time, and gravity, and it continues to be a powerful tool for understanding the universe.

## Equations

The Lorentz transformations describe how space and time appear differently to observers in relative motion:

$$
x' = \gamma(x-vt)
$$

$$
y' = y
$$

$$
z' = z
$$

$$
t' = \gamma(t-\frac{vx}{c^2})
$$

where $x$, $y$, $z$, and $t$ are the coordinates of a given point in the observer's frame, $x'$, $y'$, $z'$, and $t'$ are the coordinates of that point in the frame of the observer in relative motion, $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $v$ is the relative velocity between the two frames, and $c$ is the speed of light. 

The equation of mass-energy equivalence is Einstein's famous equation, which states that energy and mass are equivalent:

$$
E=mc^2
$$

where $E$ is energy, $m$ is mass, and $c$ is the speed of light. This equation states that a given amount of energy is equivalent to a certain amount of mass, and vice versa. This equation is important in understanding the behavior of particles and systems that have large amounts of energy, such as those found in nuclear reactions.
